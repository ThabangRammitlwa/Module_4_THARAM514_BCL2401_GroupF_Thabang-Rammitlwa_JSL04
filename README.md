# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

# Learning Reflections README 

### Overview
I followed the project brief and did what it was asked of me, the point of the project was to see if one understand Ternary operators and if one will be able to use it to console.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery
I wouldn't say i master Ternary Operators but i can safely say i am finding my around using it , and like the fact that its a shorter method.

#### Challenges Faced:
Consoling the code was no chalenge , although I kept expecting to see changes on the Gif when I run the code. I guess it's because in all our previous project we would se live changes.
#### Areas for Improvement
Need to learn more and master the Language as a whole
#### Overall Learning Experience
Ternary Operators reminded me of Tailwind ,as it is a shorter method to get results.JS is a bit difficult but with Ternary Operators, I am hopeful.
